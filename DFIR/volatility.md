## üß† What is Volatility?

**Volatility** is a free and open-source memory forensics framework used to extract digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) snapshots. It is widely used in incident response, malware analysis, reverse engineering, and threat hunting.

---

## üîí Why Use Memory Forensics?

- Detect fileless malware that leaves no disk footprint  
- Identify code injections and runtime process hollowing  
- Extract evidence of network connections, commands, registry keys, and more  
- Investigate insider threats or APTs  
- Perform incident triage on compromised endpoints

## üÜö Volatility 2 vs Volatility 3

| Feature             | Volatility 2 (Python 2) | Volatility 3 (Python 3) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Language            | Python 2                | Python 3 (actively maintained) |
| OS Profile Needed   | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚ùå No (auto-detected) |
| Plugin Format       | Global plugin space     | OS-specific (`windows.`, `linux.`) |
| Performance         | Slower                  | Faster, modular |
| Status              | Legacy                  | Recommended ‚úÖ |

## üß† Core Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Memory Dump** | A snapshot of a system's RAM (e.g., `.raw`, `.vmem`) |
| **Plugin** | A specific Volatility module used to extract info |
| **Kernel Space** | Core system memory where rootkits often hide |
| **User Space** | Normal processes and apps (Word, Chrome, etc.) |
| **Hooking** | Malicious redirection of system calls |
| **Fileless Malware** | Malware that resides only in memory |

---

## üß© Important Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `windows.pslist` | List processes (like Task Manager) |
| `windows.pstree` | Tree view of processes (parent-child relationship) |
| `windows.psscan` | Detect hidden/unlinked processes |
| `windows.malfind` | Find injected shellcode or code-injected regions |
| `windows.dlllist` | DLLs loaded by each process |
| `windows.cmdline` | Get command-line args for all processes |
| `windows.netstat` | List network connections |
| `windows.handles` | Open handles (files, registry, events, etc.) |
| `windows.filescan` | Locate file objects in memory |

---

## üß¨ Advanced Hunting Plugins

| Plugin | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `windows.ssdt` | Detect SSDT hooks (rootkit indicator) |
| `windows.modules` | List active kernel drivers |
| `windows.driverscan` | Detect hidden/malicious drivers |
| `windows.mutantscan` | Find suspicious mutexes |
| `windows.callbacks` | Dump system callback hooks |
| `windows.apihooks` | Detect API-level user-mode hooks |
| `windows.modscan` | Scan for loaded kernel modules |
| `windows.driverirp` | IRP hooking in drivers |

---

## üß™ Custom YARA Hunting

You can write custom **YARA rules** to detect malware patterns inside memory.

### Example Rule:
```bash
python3 vol.py -f memory.raw windows.yarascan --yara-rule "rule detect_mz { strings: $mz = {4D 5A} condition: $mz }"
```

YARA Rule:
```yara
rule detect_mz {
    strings:
        $mz = { 4D 5A }  // MZ Header
    condition:
        $mz
}
```
