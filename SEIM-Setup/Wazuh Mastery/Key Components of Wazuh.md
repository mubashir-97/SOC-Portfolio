Wazuh is a powerful open-source security information and event management (SIEM) tool designed to help you monitor the security of your systems, detect threats, and analyze logs in real time. It’s widely used for security monitoring, compliance management, and threat detection. If you’re new to Wazuh, understanding its components can seem overwhelming, but don’t worry! In this article, we’ll break down the key Wazuh components in simple terms.





1\. Wazuh Manager (Server)

What it is:

The Wazuh Manager is the heart of the Wazuh system. It acts as the central server responsible for managing and processing security data collected from various sources. This is where the analysis of logs and generation of security alerts take place.



What it does:

Receives logs and security events from the Wazuh Agents (installed on endpoints like servers or workstations).

Analyzes the data to detect potential security threats or abnormal behavior.

Generates alerts when suspicious activities are detected.

Why it’s important:

The Wazuh Manager helps you understand what’s happening on your network by analyzing logs, detecting threats, and notifying you of potential security risks in real time.





2\. Wazuh Agent

What it is:

The Wazuh Agent is a lightweight program that you install on the systems (servers, workstations, etc.) you want to monitor. It collects data from these systems and sends it to the Wazuh Manager for analysis.



What it does:

Collects logs and security events from the system where it is installed.

Forwards the collected data to the Wazuh Manager for processing and analysis.

Why it’s important:

The Agent ensures that the Wazuh Manager receives the necessary data from all monitored endpoints, allowing it to detect any security issues in the environment.





3\. Elasticsearch

What it is:

Elasticsearch is a powerful search engine that is used to store and index log data. It’s the backend database of Wazuh where logs and alerts are stored in a format that allows for fast searching and analysis.



What it does:

Stores and indexes the data (logs and alerts) received from Wazuh Manager.

Makes the data easily searchable and accessible for analysis.

Why it’s important:

Elasticsearch allows Wazuh to store large amounts of data efficiently and ensures that you can search through the data quickly when you need to investigate an alert or look at logs.



4\. Kibana

What it is:

Kibana is a data visualization tool that works with Elasticsearch to provide an interactive user interface. It allows you to create visualizations, dashboards, and reports from the security data stored in Elasticsearch.



What it does:

Provides a graphical interface to view and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch.

Helps you create custom dashboards to monitor security events, trends, and alerts in real time.

Why it’s important:

Kibana makes it easy to visualize and understand the security data, helping you spot trends, monitor your environment, and respond to incidents quickly.



5\. Filebeat

What it is:

Filebeat is a lightweight tool used to collect and forward log data from various sources, such as application logs, system logs, or even Docker containers, to Wazuh or Elasticsearch.



What it does:

Collects logs from various servers and systems.

Forwards the logs to the Wazuh Manager or directly to Elasticsearch for further processing and storage.

Why it’s important:

Filebeat is a simple way to collect logs from systems in your environment and forward them to Wazuh for analysis. It’s resource-efficient and works well in environments with heavy log generation.



6\. Wazuh Master Server

What it is:

The Wazuh Master Server is used in large or distributed Wazuh setups where multiple Wazuh Manager nodes are running. It coordinates the activities of these nodes.



What it does:

Manages the distribution of data and configuration between multiple Wazuh nodes (Wazuh Manager servers).

Ensures that all Wazuh nodes are working together efficiently and that data is synchronized.

Why it’s important:

In large environments, the Wazuh Master Server helps scale your monitoring infrastructure by managing multiple nodes and ensuring data consistency across the system.





7\. Wazuh Cluster

What it is:

A Wazuh Cluster is a group of Wazuh Manager nodes that work together to handle large-scale deployments. It ensures that Wazuh can scale to monitor a large number of endpoints across multiple locations.



What it does:

Distributes the workload of log processing and alert generation across multiple nodes.

Ensures high availability and fault tolerance by replicating data across the cluster.

Why it’s important:

For large organizations with many systems to monitor, a Wazuh Cluster ensures that the system can handle the volume of data and maintain uptime without failure.



8\. Wazuh API

What it is:

The Wazuh API provides a way to interact with the Wazuh system programmatically. It allows you to automate tasks, manage configurations, and retrieve data using API calls.



What it does:

Enables external systems to communicate with Wazuh.

Allows automation of tasks like generating reports, querying data, or modifying configurations.

Why it’s important:

The Wazuh API is useful for integrating Wazuh with other systems or for automating routine tasks, reducing the manual effort needed for managing Wazuh.



How All These Components Work Together

Wazuh Agent collects logs from various systems (like servers, applications, etc.).

It sends these logs to the Wazuh Manager, where they are analyzed for potential threats.

The Wazuh Manager processes the logs and generates alerts if any suspicious activity is detected.

The data is stored in Elasticsearch, which allows for efficient searching and indexing of the logs.

Kibana then presents the data in an easy-to-understand format, allowing security teams to visualize alerts, trends, and logs.

If your environment has many systems, you can use Filebeat to forward logs to Wazuh, and use a Wazuh Master Server and Cluster to manage large-scale deployments.

The Wazuh API allows you to integrate Wazuh with other tools or automate processes.

Conclusion

Wazuh is a comprehensive solution for security monitoring and incident response, providing real-time log analysis, threat detection, and visualization. The key components of Wazuh — including the Wazuh Manager, Agent, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Filebeat, and others — work together seamlessly to provide a robust and scalable security monitoring system. By understanding these components, even beginners can begin using Wazuh to monitor and protect their systems effectively.
