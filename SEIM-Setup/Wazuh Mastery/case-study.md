```

**Workflow:**

1. **Agents ‚Üí Wazuh Managers**
   Agents send logs and alerts to Master & Worker nodes.

2. **Managers ‚Üí Indexers**
   Managers forward events for indexing and storage in OpenSearch clusters.

3. **Dashboard ‚Üí Indexers & Managers**
   Dashboard pulls visualizations from indexers and communicates with managers via API.

4. **Filebeat ‚Üí Indexers ‚Üí Dashboard**
   Filebeat ensures reliable log forwarding from managers to indexers and dashboard.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary of Actions Taken

* Verified **hostnames**, `/etc/hosts`, and firewall configurations
* Ensured **time synchronization** across all nodes with `chrony`
* Generated and deployed **TLS certificates** for Indexer, Manager, and Dashboard
* Installed and configured **Wazuh Indexer cluster** (d3 & d4) with proper CN verification
* Installed **Wazuh Manager nodes** and connected to Indexers
* Installed **Wazuh Dashboard** and verified API connectivity
* Validated **Filebeat output** and log forwarding pipeline
* Created **automated validation script** for ongoing monitoring

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Key Highlights

* All nodes restored to **active, running status**
* Certificates verified with CN matching and permissions secured
* End-to-end log flow validated through Filebeat ‚Üí Indexers ‚Üí Dashboard
* Troubleshooting workflow documented for **future incidents**
