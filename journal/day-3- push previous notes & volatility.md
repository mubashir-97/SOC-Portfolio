# 📓 Day 3 – Portfolio Upload + Memory Forensics Start

🕒 Timestamp: 2025-07-15

---

## 🧠 What I Did:
- Organized and pushed previous markdown notes to GitHub
- Cleaned up folder structures for existing documentation
- Started learning **Volatility** via TryHackMe
- Practiced analyzing memory dumps (RAM images)

---

## 🔍 What I Learned:
- Importance of keeping structured, version-controlled notes
- How to find processes, open connections, and command history using Volatility
- Key memory forensics concepts: pslist, netscan, cmdline, dlllist

---

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- GitHub Desktop
- Volatility 2 / 3
- TryHackMe lab VM

---

## 🚧 What Needs More Work:
- Uploading rest of the old notes
- Practicing more complex memory artifacts (malware injection, hidden processes)
- Building a cheat sheet for Volatility commands

---

## 📌 Next Actions:
- Finish Volatility room and log findings
- Create `/forensics/` folder in GitHub for memory forensics notes
- Simulate malware infection in VM → capture memory dump → analyze with Volatility
