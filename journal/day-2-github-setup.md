🕒 Timestamp: 2025-07-15

\## 🧠 What I Did:

\- Finalized GitHub repo structure for my SOC-Portfolio

\- Created folders for log-analysis, detection-rules, attacks, and journal

\- Connected local GitHub Desktop to manage commits

\- Completed KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) room on TryHackMe

\- Practiced hands-on artifact collection and triage



---



\## 🔍 What I Learned:

\- How GitHub repositories, folders, commits, and markdown files work

\- KAPE's ability to quickly collect and parse targeted forensic artifacts

\- Difference between KAPE’s Target Collection and Module Processing

\- Key Windows forensic artifacts: Event Logs, Registry hives, Prefetch, Amcache

\- Importance of KAPE in DFIR for fast triage and IR



---



\## 🛠 Tools Explored:

\- GitHub \& GitHub Desktop

\- KAPE (EZ Tools)

\- Windows Registry Viewer

\- Event Log Viewer



---



\## 🚧 What I Didn’t Fully Understand:

\- Best ways to automate journal syncing between Notion and GitHub

\- Correlating KAPE output with attack TTPs

\- How to use KAPE modules for timeline creation



---



\## 📌 Next Steps:

\- Add Event ID and Sysmon analysis under `/log-analysis/`

\- Set up test VM → Run KAPE on a basic attack scenario

\- Extract logs → Analyze in Wazuh or manually

\- Write basic detection rule in Wazuh XML format
